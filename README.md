## Key Features ‚ú®

NIT-JSR-Hub is divided into four primary modules, each packed with its own set of features:

### üí¨ Real-Time Chat
- **Instant Messaging:** One-on-one and group conversations with real-time message delivery powered by **Pusher**.
- **Typing Indicators & Read Receipts:** See when users are typing and when your messages have been seen.
- **Rich Media:** Share images, videos, GIFs and files seamlessly within chats (up to 5MB for videos).
- **Group Management:** Easily create groups and add or remove members.

### üõí Peer-to-Peer Marketplace
- **Product Listings:** Users can create, update, and delete their product listings.
- **Media Uploads:** Multiple image and video uploads for each product, handled by **Cloudflare R2**.
- **Show Interest:** Users can express interest in products, notifying the seller and initiating a conversation.
- **Direct-to-Chat:** A "Contact Seller" button creates a private conversation between the buyer and seller.

### üé• Video Conferencing
- **Seamless Integration:** High-quality video and audio calls powered directly by the **Stream.io SDK**.
- **Schedule Meetings:** Plan and schedule future meetings with other users.
- **Recording & History:** Access a history of past meetings and view recordings, all managed by Stream's backend.

### üìÖ Attendance Tracker
- **Automated Data Scraping:** An independent **Express.js microservice** uses **Playwright** to automatically log into a college portal and scrape attendance data.
- **Data Analytics:** The microservice processes the raw data to calculate daily/weekly attendance percentages and trends.
- **Visualizations:** The frontend displays attendance data in a calendar view, with analytics charts and a student leaderboard.
- **Manual Refresh Trigger:** A "Refresh" button on the frontend can ping the microservice to wake it up and trigger an on-demand scrape.
- **Credential Management:** Users must provide their college portal credentials to enable attendance tracking.
- **Guided Setup:** First-time users receive guided instructions on setting up their credentials and using the platform.

## System Architecture üèóÔ∏è
**[system design - eraser.io](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/Apx9i6oQtdCXhSVASqn2)** üîó
This project utilizes a modular, microservice-oriented architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability. The main application is a **Next.js** monolith, while the attendance scraper runs as an independent **Express.js** microservice. A single **MongoDB** instance serves as the source of truth for all modules.

## What is the T3 Stack?

This project is built using the principles of the **T3 Stack**, which is a web development stack focused on a simple philosophy: **full-stack typesafety**.

> The goal is to provide a seamless developer experience where the data types defined in your backend are automatically shared with your frontend. This eliminates a huge category of bugs and drastically speeds up development by providing features like autocompletion across the API boundary.

It‚Äôs built around a few core, typesafe technologies that are modular and easy to work with.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- MongoDB instance (you can get a free one from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Main Next.js Application:**
    - Navigate to the root directory.
    - Install dependencies:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
      ```env
      # MongoDB
      DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"

      # NextAuth
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET="a_random_strong_secret_for_jwt"
      NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
      
      # Google OAuth (for college email authentication)
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

      # Pusher
      PUSHER_APP_ID="your_pusher_app_id"
      NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_APP_KEY="your_pusher_public_key"
      PUSHER_SECRET="your_pusher_secret"

      # Stream
      NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY="your_stream_api_key"
      STREAM_API_SECRET="your_stream_secret"

      # Cloudflare R2 (for File Storage)
      CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID="your_cloudflare_account_id"
      CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_r2_access_key_id"
      CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_r2_secret_access_key"
      CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME="your_r2_bucket_name"
      ```

3.  **Set up the Attendance Scraper Microservice:**
    - Navigate to the microservice directory:
      ```sh
      cd microservices/attendance-scraper
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in this directory (`/microservices/attendance-scraper`) and add the following:
      ```env
      # Database
      DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string" # Should be the same as above

      # College Portal Credentials for the scraper bot
      COLLEGE_PORTAL_USERNAME="your_college_portal_login_id"
      COLLEGE_PORTAL_PASSWORD="your_college_portal_password"

      # Server Port
      PORT=3001
      ```

### Running the Application

You'll need to run both the frontend and the microservice in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server (from the root directory):**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Express.js scraper server (from the `/microservices/attendance-scraper` directory):**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The scraper microservice will be running on `http://localhost:3001`.
