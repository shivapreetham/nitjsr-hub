first of all i want you to spot the novice errors in the existing project code and make it really 
production ready and really of good quality and showable.
modular

i want you to add next auth oauth using google provider along with current credential provider, \                                   │
│     but the major thing is that i need the regex of the email followed .email()                                                       │
│       .regex(/^(20\d{2})(ug|pg)([a-z]+)(\d{3})@nitjsr\.ac\.in$/, {                                                                    │
│         message: "Please fill a valid email address (ending with @nitjsr.ac.in)"\                                                     │
│     this kind of a regex in the email , ie it should be institute email, \\                                                           │
│   \                                                                                                                                   │
│   along with that i want you to remove the NITUsername and NITPassword from compulsary credentials , \                                │
│   and from sign-up page also remove it , \                                                                                            │
│   \                                                                                                                                   │
│   and make it possible that if a new user comes he can just login with google, \                                                      │
│   and it should have proper error handling along with production level code 
    i used to trigger a certain website whenever a person joins in ,that part we remove, 
    but we have to have the group management logic run even on google login,

    while also ensureing that i have the attendance feature for the person who is joining right now, 
    if he doesnt happen to have NITPassword and NITUsername and he goes to attendance page, 
    we say that he doesnt have credentials, and pop up the profile button where he can add the credential
    
    and therefore also add a start scraping button which sends the user email to a server with post request, 
    server url will be in env by name of scrapingServerSpecific
